gitcvsimport [-v] cvsroot module directory
    Make a new git repository in \`directory' which
    is a copy of the CVS module obtained from cvsroot.
    With the -v option full verbosity is enabled. 

    In such a repository the {n} naming scheme for
    commits will not work for imported CVS commits,
    and instead you should use ~n, where n is a natural
    number.  ~n and {n} are similar, but there are some
    differences, and {n} is better when imported CVS
    commits are not involved.

    If you get an error fetching a file that should not
    be in the CVS repository, remove all lines naming
    the file from the file CVSROOT/history in the
    repository, and try again."
