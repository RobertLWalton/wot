gitdiff [ {n} | ~n ] [-a | filename ...]
    Lists differences between the working versions of
    files and either a previous committed version of the
    files or the last gitadd'ed versions.

    With no argument, does this for all files in the
    current directory and its subdirectories.  With -a
    argument, for all files in all repository director-
    ies.  Otherwise only for the listed files.

    With no commit name argument, diffs working versions
    with the last gitadd'ed version if that exists, or
    the last committed version otherwise.  With a commit
    name, diffs the working version with the version in
    the commit."
