cvsrepository pattern replacement

    Print (with no arguments) or change (with two argu-
    ments) the CVS repository of the current directory.

    When the repository is changed, the pattern and
    replacement are as per the sed(1) substitute (s)
    command.  The changes affect both the current dir-
    ectory and all subdirectories of it, recursively.'
