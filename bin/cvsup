cvsup [-E] [file-or-directory ...]

    Update the given files and directories (and all
    files and subdirectories in these directories), or
    if none given, update all the files and subdirec-
    tories of the current directory, by checking out the
    latest revisions of the files from the repository so
    as to create local copies of these files where no
    local copies exist and patch (update) existing local
    copies that are older than the repository revisions.

    Normally subdirectories that are empty in the repo-
    sitory (or whose only files are in their Attic; see
    cvsrm) are deleted locally.  The -E option changes
    this to create such empty directories locally.

    Ignores files whose local copy is an unmodified copy
    of the latest revision of the file in the reposi-
    tory.  If the local file has been modified since it
    was checked out, cvsup announces this and takes
    appropriate action: see the M and C flags below.

    The `cvsutd'"'"' command can be used to print out
    the same thing as cvsup but without actually chang-
    ing any files or directories.

    Some of the possible printed messages are:

    ? filename	Local file is not known to CVS.  If you
    		want files in the current directory to
		be invisible to CVS so they are not
		listed in lines like these, use
		cvsignore.

    U filename	Local file did not exist and has been
    		copied from the repository.

    P filename	Existing local file has NOT been modi-
    		fied since it was checked out, but a
		more recent revision has since been
		checked into the repository (by someone
		else).  The local file is patched so it
		is now the same as the most recent repo-
		sitory file.

    M filename	Local file has been modified since it
    		was checked out, and the revision of the
		local file that was checked out is still
		the latest revision in the repository.
		The local file is not altered.

    C filename	Local file is a modification of a repo-
    		sitory revision of the file that is NOT
		the most recent revision of the file in
		the repository.  The most recent revi-
		sion in the repository (provided by
		someone else) is merged into the local
		file by the rcsmerge(1) command.  If
		there are overlapping changes, a warning
		is printed, and both changes are inser-
		ted in the file, between lines contain-
		ing `<<<<<<<'"'"' and `>>>>>>>'"'"'.

		BEWARE: even non-overlapping changes
		may conflict and cause the file to be
		defective.  Use `cvsdiff -rHEAD'"'"' to
		examine changes from the lastest repo-
		sitory revision.

    A filename	File has been `cvsadd'"'"'ed but not yet
    		been `cvscom'"'"'mited to the reposi-
		tory.

    R filename	File has been `cvs remove'"'"'d but
    		this remove has not yet been commited
		to the repository.  If you use
		`cvsrm'"'"' and `cvsattic'"'"' you
		should never see this.'
