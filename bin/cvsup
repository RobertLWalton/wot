    Update the given files and directories (and all
    files and subdirectories in these directories), or
    if none given, update all the files and subdirec-
    tories of the current directory, by checking out the
    latest versions of the files from the repository so
    as to create local copies of these files where no
    local copies exist and patch (update) existing local
    copies that are older than the repository versions.

    Ignores files whose local copy is an unmodified copy
    of the latest version of the file in the repository.
    If the local file has been modified since it was
    checked out, cvsup announces this and takes
    appropriate action: see the M and C flags below.

    The `cvsutd'"'"' command can be used to print out
    the same thing as cvsup but without actually chang-
    ing any files or directories.

    Some of the possible printed messages are:

    ? filename	Local file is not known to CVS.  If you
    		want files in the current directory to
		be invisible to CVS so they are not
		listed in lines like these, use
		cvsignore.

    U filename	Local file did not exist and has been
    		copied from the repository.

    P filename	Existing local file has NOT been modi-
    		fied since it was checked out, but a
		more recent version has since been
		checked into the repository (by someone
		else).  The local file is patched so it
		is now the same as the most recent repo-
		sitory file.

    M filename	Local file has been modified since it
    		was checked out, and the version of the
		local file that was checked out is still
		the latest version in the repository.
		The local file is not altered.

    C filename	Local file is a modification of a repo-
    		sitory version of the file that is NOT
		the most recent version of the file in
		the repository.  The most recent version
		in the repository (provided by someone
		else) is merged into the local file by
		the rcsmerge(1) command.  If there are
		overlapping changes, a warning is
		printed, and both changes are inserted
		in the file, between lines containing
		`<<<<<<<'"'"' and `>>>>>>>'"'"'.

		BEWARE: even non-overlapping changes
		may conflict and cause the file to be
		defective.  Use `cvsdiff -rHEAD'"'"' to
		examine changes from the lastest repo-
		sitory version.

    A filename	File has been `cvsadd'"'"'ed but not yet
    		been `cvscom'"'"'mited to the reposi-
		tory.

    R filename	File has been `cvs remove'"'"'d but
    		this remove has not yet been commited
		to the repository.  If you use
		`cvsrm'"'"' and `cvsattic'"'"' you
		should never see this.'
