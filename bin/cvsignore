    Make the listed files ignored by CVS so they will
    not appear in `? filename'"'"' lines when cvsutd
    or cvscom is run.  Patterns with `*'"'"',' \
    	'`?'"'"', and `[...]'"'"'
    may also be given, but must be quoted.  The files
    to be ignored must be in the current directory.

    If no files or patterns are given, the current list
    of ignored files and patterns is printed.

    Specifically the listed files and patterns are added
    as lines to the ./.cvsignore file and that file is
    checked in.  You can also edit and cvscom this file
    if you want to un-ignore files or adjust patterns.
    Printing the currently ignored files and patterns is
    equivalent to printing the ./.cvsignore file.'
