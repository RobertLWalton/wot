Overview
--------

A git repository is a parent directory and its descend-
ants in the directory tree.  The repository proper is in
the ./.git subdirectory of the parent directory.  The
files in the parent directory and its descendants are
called the working files.  The repository holds commits,
which are snapshots of all the working files and their
containing directories taken together.  Commits cannot
be changed.  The repository also holds an \`index',
which is like a commit that has not been finalized yet
and which can be changed.  The \`commit' operation makes
a new commit that includes all the files in the index
and all the working files that have been modified since
their last commit.  Not included are files that are not
in either the index or latest commit.

A git repository can have a remote copy called the
\`remote origin' of the repository.  This copy is
generally \`bare', meaning it has just an equivalent
of the .git directory and has no working files.  The
last commit of the repository can be pushed to the
remote origin, and the last commit pushed to the
remote origin can be pulled to the repository.  Thus
if several repositories on different machines share the
same remote origin, a new commit can be made in one of
these repositories, pushed to the remote origin, and
pulled to the other repositories.

There can be a conflict if two different commits are
made in different repositories with the same remote
origin.  The first commit to be pushed will succeed.
The second will fail, and the conflict will have to
be resolved.

At any time the \`current repository' is the repository
containing the current directory, which may be a
descendant of the parent directory of the repository.

Git saves the user executable bit of the file mode,
but does not save any other file mode bit.  Two versions
of the file differ if their user executable mode bits
differ, but not if any other mode bits differ.
