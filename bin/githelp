Overview
--------

A git repository is a parent directory and its descend-
ants in the directory tree.  The repository proper is in
the ./.git subdirectory of the parent directory.  The
files in the parent directory and its descendants are
called the working files.  The repository holds commits,
which are snapshots of all the working files and their
containing directories taken together.  Commits cannot
be changed.

The repository also holds an \`index', which contains
instructions to change, add, remove, or rename files
when making a new commit from the last commit.  The
index can be changed.  The index also holds versions of
files, but we view this as just a convenience for compu-
ting the differences between sets of changes to a file
when none of the changes has been committed.

A file is said to be \`committable' if it is mentioned
in the index or is in the last commit.  The \`commit'
operation makes a new commit that includes all commit-
table files except those which the index instructions
remove or rename.  The commit operation uses the index
instructions to make the new commit from the last
commit and the working files, and then clears the index.

A git repository can have a remote copy called the
\`remote origin' of the repository.  This copy is
generally \`bare', meaning it has just an equivalent
of the .git directory and has no working files.  The
last commit of the repository can be pushed to the
remote origin, and the last commit pushed to the
remote origin can be pulled to the repository.  Thus
if several repositories on different machines share the
same remote origin, a new commit can be made in one of
these repositories, pushed to the remote origin, and
pulled to the other repositories.

There can be a conflict if two different commits are
made in different repositories with the same remote
origin.  The first commit to be pushed will succeed.
The second will fail, and the conflict will have to
be resolved by whoever did the second push.

At any time the \`current repository' is the repository
containing the current directory, which may be a
descendant of the parent directory of the repository.

Note that for each file version git saves the contents
of the file and the user executable bit of the file
mode, but does not save any other file mode bit.  Two
versions of the file with the same content still differ
if one has the user mode executable bit on and the other
does not.  Upon being retrieved from a commit, the file
mode will be 666 or 777 according to the saved execu-
table bit, and this will be modified by the OS umask
setting (typically to 640 or 750).
