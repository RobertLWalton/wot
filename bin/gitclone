gitclone repositoryname directory
    Make \`directory' into a repository holding a copy
    of the \`repositoryname' repository, and make
    \`repositoryname' the remote origin of this copy.
    A repository can have only one remote origin.

    The `\repositoryname' directory should not exist
    before gitclone is executed.  It may be a remote
    directory.  It may be an ssh accessible directory
    with a name of the form

        user@host:pathname

    where pathname is local to the user's home directory
    on the host.  Note this is a name that could be feed
    directly to rsync.

    Alternatively \`repositoryname' can be a URL of the
    form

        http://...

    or
    	ftp://...

    which should reference an internet accessible reposi-
    tory directory.  Note that in this case it will not
    be possible to use gitpush to push commits from the
    current repository to its remote origin."
