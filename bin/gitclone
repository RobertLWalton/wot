    and make \`repositoryname' the remote origin of
    this copy.  A repository can have only one remote
    origin.

    If the repository being copied is not a local
    directory, \`repositoryname' should have the form

        user@host:pathname

    where pathname is local to the user's home directory
    on the host.  Note this is a name that could be feed
    directly to rsync.
