    Make \`directory' into a repository holding a copy
    of the \`repositoryname' repository, and make
    \`repositoryname' the remote origin of this copy.
    A repository can have only one remote origin.

    If \`repositoryname' does not name a local direc-
    tory, it should have the form

        user@host:pathname

    where pathname is local to the user's home directory
    on the host.  Note this is a name that could be feed
    directly to rsync.
