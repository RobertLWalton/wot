gitfetch
    Fetch all the commits from current repository's
    remote origin to the local version of the remote
    repository (whose head is \`origin/HEAD').
    
    The current repository \`HEAD' can then be diffed
    with \`origin/HEAD'.  Note that gitfetch is
    automatically executed by programs that accept
    \`r' as a commit name."
