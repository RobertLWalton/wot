    Print (with no arguments) or change (with two argu-
    ments) the CVS project of the current directory.

    When the project is changed, the pattern and
    replacement are as per the sed(1) substitute (s)
    command.  The changes affect both the current dir-
    ectory and all subdirectories of it, recursively.'
