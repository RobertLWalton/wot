xsh [ZOOM]
xsh [-xterm] [PP]"

Opens a new X-window running the shell, using gnome-
terminal if that exists and the -xterm option is NOT
given; else using xterm.

If gnome-terminal is used the default profile is used
and its normal font size (and with it terminal window
size) is multiplied by ZOOM, which defaults to 1.0.
You may change the font/window size after the terminal
window is created by typing control + to increase and
control - to decrease.  From such a terminal window you
may open another terminal window by typing control N or
another tab of the current window by typing control T,
and you may switch from one tab to another by typing
control page-up and control page-down.

If xterm is used, the normal font size is changed to PP
(default 25).  The lucidatypewriter font is used if that
is available, and otherwise adobe-courier is used.  You
can also suffix `b'"'"' to PP, as in `18b'"'"', to' \
    'force a bold
font.'
