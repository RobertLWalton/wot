xsh [-xterm] [PP]"

Opens a new X-window running the shell, using gnome-
terminal if that exists and the -xterm option is NOT
given; else using xterm.

If gnome-terminal is used the Default profile is used
and its normal font size (and with it terminal window
size) is multiplied by ZOOM, which defaults to 1.7 if
the Default profile uses the system font, and to 1.0
otherwise.  You may change the font/window size after
the terminal window is created by typing control + to
increase and control - to decrease.  From such a ter-
minal window you may open another terminal window by
typing control N or another tab of the current window
by typing control T.

If xterm is used, the normal font size is changed to PP
(default 25).  The lucidatypewriter font is used if that
is available, and otherwise adobe-courier is used.  You
can also suffix `b'"'"' to PP, as in `18b'"'"', to' \
    'force a bold
font.'
