gitpull [remote]
    Pull all the commits from current repository's
    remote origin, or the designated remote, to the
    current repository, and merge the latest pulled
    commit with the latest commit in the current
    repository to form a new commit.

    If the remote origin contains changes that conflict
    with the current repository, this fails, and you
    should use gitconflict, then gitmerge, then gitpush.

    The index must be committed first, so all working
    files match their last committed version.  If this
    is not the case, gitpull complains and aborts."
