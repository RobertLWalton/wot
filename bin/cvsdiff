cvsdiff [options] [file_or_directory ...]

    Make a diff listing with the latest revision that
    YOU last checked out or in (as per cvsup or cvscom)
    of the given files and all files and subdirectories
    in each given directory, or if none given, of all
    the files and subdirectories in the current direc-
    tory.

    Note that it is common to use `cvsdiff | less'"'"',
    as all cvs standard error output is piped by cvsdiff
    to the standard output, so it is unnecessary to do
    anything special with the standard error output.
    Also note that if you just want to see a list of
    files that are different from their most recent
    repository revisions, cvsutd is better than cvsdiff.

    Some options are:

    -rX.Y	Diff with repository revision X.Y
    		instead of with the last revision YOU
		checked out or in.  Use cvslog to see
		list of committed revisions and their
		dates for particular files (each file is
		different).

    -rHEAD	Diff with the last revision checked in
    		by anyone, i.e., the latest revision in
		the repository, instead of with the last
		revision YOU checked out or in.

    -rT		Diff with the repository revision that
    		was given tag T (see cvstag).

    diff(1)	You can use standard diff(1) options,
    option	such as -b, -w, --minimal.  If no
                options are given or the first option
		is not -c* or -u*, the -u3 option is
		added.'
