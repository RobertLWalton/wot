cvsdiff [options] [file_or_directory ...]

    Make a diff listing with the latest version that YOU
    last checked out or in (as per cvsup or cvscom) of
    the given files and all files and subdirectories in
    each given directory, or if none given, of all the
    files and subdirectories in the current directory.
    Some options are:

    -rX.Y	Diff with repository version X.Y instead
    		of with the last version YOU checked
		out or in.  Use cvslog to see list of
		committed versions and their dates.

    -rHEAD	Diff with the last version checked in
    		by anyone, i.e., the latest version in
		the repository, instead of with the
		last version YOU checked out or in.

    -rT		Diff with the repository version that
    		was given tag T (see cvstag).

    -l		With no files given, diff only the files
    		in the current directory and ignore its
		subdirectories (suppress recursion).

    diff(1)	You can use standard diff(1) options,
    option	such as -b, -w, --minimal.'
