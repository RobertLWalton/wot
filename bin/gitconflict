gitconflict remote [ filename ...]
    Examine differences between the remote repository
    and the working files.  Here remote can be \`origin'
    or some other remote repository.  Then if no 
    arguments are given, this just lists the files that
    differ between the remote repository and the working
    files.

    With arguments, produces gitdiff listings for chang-
    ing the remote versions of the named files to the
    working versions.  The argument \`.' will do this
    for just all files in the current directory and its
    subdirectories.  gitmerge can be used to merge
    remote files into the working files (which must be
    committed first)."
