gitconflict [ filename ...]
    With no arguments, just lists the files that differ
    between the remote origin and the working files.
    With arguments, produces gitdiff listings for chang-
    ing the remote origin versions of the named files to
    the working versions.  The argument \`.' will do
    this for just all files in the current directory and
    its subdirectories.  gitmerge can be used to merge
    remote origin files into the working files (which
    must be committed first)."
