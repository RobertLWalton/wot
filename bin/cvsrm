    Remove files in a CVS repository to the Attic.  Once
    there, these files behave as if they are not in the
    repository, except that tagged revisions of the
    files may be obtained via cvsout -rtag, file revi-
    sions may be obtained by cvsold, and the files will
    continue to be listed by cvslog.  This is useful if
    the files are part of some previously tagged project
    revision, but if not, then perhaps the files should
    be completely expunged from the repository by
    cvsexpunge instead of being removed to the Attic.'
