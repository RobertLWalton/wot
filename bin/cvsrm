    Put files in a CVS repository in the Attic.  Once
    there, these files are as if they are removed,
    except that versions of them may be obtained via
    cvsold, they will continue to be listed by cvslog,
    and versions can continue to be obtained via cvsout
    with an -rTAG option.  This is useful if the files
    are part of some previously tagged version of a
    project, but if not, then perhaps the files should
    be completely expunged from the repository by cvsrm
    instead of being put in the Attic.'
