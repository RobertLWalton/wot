     [-a | [--] filename ...]
    Lists differences between the working versions of
    files and either a previous committed version of the
    files or the last gitadd'ed versions.

    \`l' is synonymous with \`~0'; \`r' is \
synonymous
    with \`FETCH_HEAD' after \`git fetch'; \`f' is syn-
    onymous with \`FETCH_HEAD' withOUT any \`git fetch'
    (use this with \`gitfetch remote').

    With no filenames and no -a option, lists differ-
    ences for all files in the current directory and its
    subdirectories.  With -a option, for all files in
    all repository directories.  Otherwise only for the
    listed files.

    With no commit name arguments, diffs working ver-
    sions the last gitadd'ed version if that exists,
    or the last committed version otherwise.  With one
    commit name, diffs the working version with the
    version in the commit.  With two commit names, diffs
    the versions in the two commits.

    The -n option is shorthand for the git diff option
    --name-status that just lists the names and status
    of the files with differences.  The -R option is a
    standard git diff option the reverses order of the
    files being diff'ed and may be useful in \`gitd
    r -R' when the remote is more up to date than the
    local version." | less -F
