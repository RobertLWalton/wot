cvstag tag

    First commit (as per cvscom), then update (as per
    cvsup), and then tag all current project file revi-
    sions with the given tag.  The tag can be any symbol
    not beginning with a digit.

    Specifically, a tag on a file is an abbreviation for
    a particular revision of the file.  By tagging the
    current revisions of all files in a project, you
    tag a revision of the project as a whole.  This pro-
    ject revision can then be checked out with cvsout
    using the -rtag option, in order to recover the
    tagged revision of the project.'
