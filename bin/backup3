backup [-tgz] [-move] [-raw] [-burn] [-check] [-clean]\
NAME ...

    Backs up the NAME'd items which are defined in
    the file BACKUP.rc of the current directory.
    This file contains lines of the form:

    	NAME_directories="DIRECTORY ..."

    to define each name.  The file must also contain
    a line of the form

    	host=THISHOST

    to define THISHOST.

    For each DIRECTORY creates the file THISHOST-
    DIRECTORY-DATE.tgz in the current directory.  In
    the name of this file, \`/'s are deleted from the
    beginning and end of DIRECTORY and changed to \`-/'s
    elsewhere in DIRECTORY.  Deletes any old version of
    this file.  Excludes files listed in DIRECTORY/
    .backup-ignore from the .tgz (.backup-ignore is
    passed as the --exclude-from argument to tar).

    Then proceeds according to the settings of the
    BACKUP.rc.
    
    If BACKUP.rc file contains

    	NAME_remote_directory=REMOTE_DIRECTORY

    this program executes for each DIRECTORY:

    	efm moveto REMOTE_DIRECTORY \\
	    THISHOST-DIRECTORY-DATE.tgz

    The REMOTE_DIRECTORY name must be acceptable to scp.
    At the end of this program,

    	efm list DIRECTORY ...

    is executed listing all DIRECTORIES moved by efm.

    If for a given NAME, BACKUP.rc contains

    	name_make_cd=1

    this program creates the file:

    	THISHOST-NAME-DATE.raw

    containing the raw CD image.  It then executes

    	cdrecord -v CD-OPTIONS THISHOST-NAME-DATE.raw
	eject /dev/cdrom

    where CD-OPTIONS if it exists is defined by the
    BACKUP.rc line

    	cd_options="CD-OPTIONS"

    In particular, the line

    	cd_options="-raw"

    option should be used if your CD driver has bad
    firmware so the check below often does not work.

    Lastly this program tests the CD by executing

	cmp /dev/cdrom THISHOST-NAME-DATE.raw
    	eject /dev/cdrom

    Lastly cleans up by executing

    	rm THISHOST-DIRECTORY-DATE.tgz ... \\
	   THISHOST-NAME-DATE.raw

    If several CD's are made, this program pauses be-
    tween CD's to permit manual change of CDs.

    The -tgz option suppresses the making of .tgz files,
    which must already exist.  -move suppresses using
    \`efm moveto' for the .tgz file.  -raw suppresses
    making .raw files, -burn suppresses burning CD's,
    -check suppresses checking CD's, and -clean suppres-
    ses .tgz and .raw file removal for CD's, and changes
    \`efm moveto' to \`efm copyto' so .tgz files are not
    deleted by efm.
