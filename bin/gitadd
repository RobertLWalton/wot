gitadd [filename ...]

    Copy working files to the index if they differ from
    copies already in the index or from any last
    committed version if there is no version of a file
    in the index.
    
    If no filenames are given, only files in the current
    directory and its subdirectories are considered.
    These are first listed, and you are asked whether to
    continue.

    If filenames are given that were not previously
    committed or added to the index, these are added to
    the index so they will be added to the next commit.
    Directory names should NOT be given unless you want
    all files in the named directories and their sub-
    directories to be added."
