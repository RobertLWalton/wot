gitadd
gitadd filename ...

    Add files to the current git index.

    If no filenames are given, only files in the current
    directory or its subdirectories that are already in
    the repository and that have been added or removed
    are added to the index.

    If filenames are given, these files are added to the
    index.  This should only be done for files not in
    the repository.  Directories should NOT be added,
    only files; a directory will be added when a file
    within it is added, but adding a directory is
    equivalent to adding all the files in the directory
    and its subdirectories.
