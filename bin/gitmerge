gitmerge [remote]
    Merge files from the current repository's remote
    origin or designated remote to the current
    repository.  Does an implicit fetch of the \`master'
    branch of the current or remote repository, and then
    merges this branch into the working files.

    Use this if gitpull fails.  Use gitconflict first
    to see the nature of the failure.  Some files may
    have merge conflicts that have to be adjusted by
    editing and committing them after running gitmerge,
    in which case you may need to run gitpush after
    committing the files to finish resolving the
    conflicts.

    All files must be committed first.  If this is
    not the case, gitmerge complains and aborts."
