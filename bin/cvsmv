cvsmv file1 file2

    First commit (as per cvscom) file1 and then move
    (rename) it to file2.  Lastly make file2 user writ-
    able if file1 was writable before it was committed.

    More specifically, after file1 is committed then
    the CVS repository file1,v is moved to the CVS
    repository file2,v.  After the move a cvs update is
    performed on both file1 and file2, which removes
    file1 and makes a local copy of file2.  Lastly
    this local copy is made user writable if file1 was
    writable before it was committed.'
